## Search criteria

> A random sample of 300 research articles was selected for the present study. 
Articles were identified using the PubMed database. 
>
> Search criteria were as follows: 
> - all articles mentioned the term “fMRI” (or “functional MRI”, or “functional magnetic resonance imaging”) in the title or abstract; 
> - all articles mentioned the term “brain” in the title or abstract; 
> - articles were written in English; 
> - all articles were published from 2007 and on; 
> - and all articles included the term “humans” in the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) description. 
>
> Articles classified as reviews or meta-analyses were excluded from the search. 
>
> Finally, to ensure that independent researchers without access to closed-access journals can replicate this report, only articles with the full text available in the open-access database PubMed Central (PMC) were considered in the present study.

> These criteria yielded 1392 articles. Of these results, 300 articles were selected at random for further review. Upon manual inspection of these articles, 59 were excluded from analysis. Articles were excluded if they did not present original fMRI data; if data were simulated or generated using a phantom, rather than human subjects; or if they were focused solely on methods development or evaluation. Thus, a total of 241 research reports were included in this analysis.
